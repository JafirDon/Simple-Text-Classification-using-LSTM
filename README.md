# Simple-Text-Classification-using-LSTM

I created Simple Text Classification using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) on IMDB movie review sentiment classification dataset, which I have implemented using Keras.<br><br>
If you want to more clear explonation, see my blog  [Simple Text Classification using LSTM for Beginners](https://techyscientists.blogspot.com/2021/09/simple-text-classification-using-lstm.html)

## Installation

To run the web app on your local computer, install the required libraries, These packages are included in requirement.txt. In this project used Python3.8.0.
Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>
`pip install -r requirement.txt` <br><br>
or<br><br>
If you use jupyter notebook run the following command in anaconda prompt terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>

`conda install --file requirements.txt`
<br>
<br>

## Getting Started

We create model for simple text classification using LSTM. It is type of deep learning networks. It is variation of reccurent neural network. In this neural network, has feedback connections.
