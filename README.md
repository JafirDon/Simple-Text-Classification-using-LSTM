# Simple-Text-Classification-using-LSTM

I created Breast Cancer prediction using Convolutional neural network on breast cancer data, which I have implemented using Keras.<br><br>
If you want to more clear explonation, see my blog  [Simple Text Classification using LSTM for Beginners](https://techyscientists.blogspot.com/2021/09/simple-text-classification-using-lstm.html)

## Installation

To run the web app on your local computer, install the required libraries, These packages are included in requirement.txt. In this project used Python3.8.0.
Run the following command in terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>
`pip install -r requirement.txt` <br><br>
or<br><br>
If you use jupyter notebook run the following command in anaconda prompt terminal to install the required packages.<br><br>

`conda install --file requirements.txt`
<br>
<br>

## Getting Started

We create model for breast cancer prediction model using convolutional neural network. It is type of deep learning networks. It is used for classification, segmentation and image processing problems. In this neural network, extract the features from input layer and perform mathematical convolutional operation.
